##Get started Thoft!

###In your command prompt (preferably Powershell!) (in a NEW folder created for this project!)

```
git clone https://github.com/xemmel/ThoftPJ.git .
```

### Change some code yourself

- Make some changes (add a file file or something)
- Add the changes to staging:
```
git add .
```
- Commit your changes (this is still only a LOCAL commit)
```
git commit -m "A description of the changes I made"
```
- Push your commit to github (if you are uncertain if others have made changes between last time you synced with github do a pull first)
```
(git pull)
git push 
```

##Using _Save to File_

Write a file pattern in the text box, use the following if you need a unique file name

```
c:\temp\%GUID%.xml
```
